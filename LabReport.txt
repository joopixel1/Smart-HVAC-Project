Simulation Lab
1) We learned that we can write code for controlling devices without having the hardware at all. By 
simulating the values that could be given by sensors, we can get the logic of the system sorted. 
Moving classes to different files works as a better way to make the code easier to understand by 
people compared to having everything in a long file. Finally, Git wants to upload everything into 
the cloud but we can use the .gitignore file to exclude sensitive files from being uploaded.

a. The variable functions is a list of tasks that get appended in the simulation file. functions 
then gets called in as a loop to run all of the tasks.
b. node_type is created and set from the node_config.py file. It is hard coded within the 
node_config.py file to 0.
c. NODE_TYPE_SIMULATED also comes from the node_config.py file. It is hardcoded to 0 
and compared to node_config.py in code.py
d. Simulations.get_instance() will run simulation.py within code.py. It will run the class 
Simulation with num_zones imported from node_config.
e. The line f() runs each function stored in the list function[]. This acts as the main 
application loop
3) The simulation model gets the number of zones from node_config.py, which it will use its 
simulation class functions. Get_temperature_f() will open zone.py and find the hard-coded value 
of 20 under self.temp within the __init__(self) function of class Zone. This simulates a constant 
temperature readout of 20 instead of looking to the temperature probesâ€™ values. 
The damper runs in a similar way, with the percent opened or shut being hard coded in the 
zone.py __init__(self) function. Percent is set to 0 in our simulation. 
The update_temps() function throttles how often the program checks for the temperature. The 
simulation will try updating the temperature as fast as it can, and the update_temps() will keep 
the program from updating until the time
4 & 5)
While this is lab is supposed to simulate the HVAC lab coming up, I believe it would be easier if 
there was a simpler project skeleton than this one so that we can understand each individual 
file. While this one is fully fleshed out with networking, pip, and putty; a simple temperature 
measurement node, an actuation file, and the code/simulation files would have worked.
